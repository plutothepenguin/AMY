          Dear Amy,<br><br>Oh mah GAWSH AMY ITS YOUR BIRTHDAY!! WHAT THE JAMMIN FRANKLIN!! I cannot BELIEVE you're 20 already!! What in tarnipples. You a full boomer now lesgo. I just wanted to let you know how much you mean to me. You my homie, a rank given only to my bestest of friends. I remember that very first time we met on bonk. I instantly fell in love with your name. amy yo. Amy. Frickin. Yo. Best name ever. I knew we'd be friends for forever (and also ever). And that's Never Gonna Change. You've supported me so much through out the years. I remember when I first broke up with Monica, you were the only one fully there for me. Oh lawd I'm crying already. Even when everyone else was too busy for me, you made the time to help me out no matter what. You've come so far tho. I remember when you first told me you were going into uni. I got so excited for you!! And now you've been there for an entire year and a half, and you're striving. You're so much happier now than when I first met you, and more confident too. You've shown me so much new music too!! Coldplay, The 1975, The Coins, Clairo, Broods. And I loved them allll. Oh mah gawddd I'm writing this and I know I should be writing about our past experiences but honestly I just wanna burst out in emotions I'm crying rn lmaooo I'm stewpid. You are actually so freaking amazing. That random gift out of nowhere?? I have NEVER had a friend do that to me and oh my lord my heart cannot handle it what did I do in my life to deserve such an amazing friend?? I would do it 100 times more. Thank you so much. And the way you listen any time I vent about Aya, even though I already have hundreds of times?? That's Amy right there, frickin incredibros. I wish we could be even closer. Someday I shall meat you IRL and it will be amazing. You better be ready cuz it's gonna come outta nowhere. I hope you know, the amount that I compliment to your face?? That's nothing. All my friends know about you. also if im completely honest i think ur a catch. The fact that I've never once lost contact with you in the four years we've known each other speaks for itself. But ahhh you're such a frickin splendid person you honestly deserve the entire world. Thank you so so much for everything, Amy. I genuinely appreciate you so much. Wanna be friends for another 70 years?<br><br>Love you,<br>Ya Homeboi Omid
